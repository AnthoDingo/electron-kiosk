# Electron KIOSK

Simple Electron app to open a website in fullscreen KIOSK mode.

## Usage

You can download latest release from releases section and choose the right package for your platform.

1. Run the application, main settings windows will open by default with the url to load.
2. Edit settings and on `UPDATE` button, the url will be loaded in fullscreen mode.

Starting from now the application will always load that url on startup, if the url is not reachable, the application will show a loader until the url is reachable again.
